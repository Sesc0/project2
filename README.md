## project2

machine learning attempt to incorporate a number of data sources to give a multi-month warning to traders to start derisking their portfolios in preparation for a broad market downturn

# data sources used:
         - Emerging markets HYCBIY value
         - Personal consumption expenditures value
         - SPY index value closing prices
         - 1 troy oz gold price 
         - 10 year treasury bond interest rate yield
 
# training data
        - DJIA index closing prices

the model attempts to locate patterns commonly found in broad market downturns, identify when those are playing out in the present, and predict the likelihood of occurrence in the future

# Initial training criteria:
         - at least 5 periods worth of data for evaluation
         - >= 67% of previous periods meeting criteria for positive marking by program
         - correlational coefficient above .25 with at least 2 other datasets

# MOASS is coming
